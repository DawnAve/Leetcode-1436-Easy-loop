# Leetcode-1436-Easy-loop
Another easy problem. One bug that I encountered is the sequence in the loop. If I do everything inside one loop, I will ignore the cities that appear in the i[0] first, leading to bugs. Interestingly, there seems no way better solutions to this problem, everyone gets pretty much the same complexity.
